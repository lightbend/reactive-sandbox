# reactive-sandbox

This project is a component of [Lightbend Orchestration for Kubernetes](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/lightbend-orchestration-kubernetes/latest/). Refer to its documentation for usage, examples, and reference information.

It implements a small Docker image containing common dependencies for running [Lightbend Reactive Platform](https://www.lightbend.com/products/reactive-platform) applications. This includes minimal versions of:

* Cassandra
* Elasticsearch
* Kafka
* ZooKeeper

This image is meant to be used during development. It is not production grade.

## Project Status

Lightbend Orchestration is no longer actively developed and will reach its [End of Life](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/lightbend-platform/2.0/support-terminology/index.html#end-of-life-eol-) on April 15, 2020.

We recommend [Migrating to the Improved Kubernetes Deployment Experience](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/lightbend-orchestration/current/migration.html).
